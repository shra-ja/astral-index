## Milestone 2 review remediation

Integrated through PR #3 (`20428aa`). Parser fixes preserve precise JSON
numbers, reject duplicate members and enforce the exact timestamp shape. History
reads verify stored identity and domain invariants. A shared library root separates
HSR and storage modules. Test discovery now covers additional frontend/tooling
suites; native CSP verification checks a policy violation and has a permissive-policy
mutation probe. The shell copy reflects the acquisition-first roadmap.

`npm run check` passed: 46 Rust tests, 17 frontend/tooling tests, native offline
integration, five failure/discovery probes, source/report validation, TypeScript,
formatting and Clippy. All required coverage metrics are 100% per source file.
The regression tests reproduced the four data issues before fixes; the new-suite
probe confirmed the old command omitted tests. See [testing](../../development/TESTING.md) for
red/green and mutation evidence. `npm run tauri -- build --no-bundle` also passed for Linux.
Review fixes are integrated on `main`.
The existing branch history is preserved; subsequent service work should use
smaller reviewed increments and the same-day integration target in CONTRIBUTING.
